## A

### Accuracy

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Accuracy is defined as the fraction of correct classifications out of the total number of samples; it resembles one way to assess the performance of a predictor and is often used synonymous to [specificity](#specificity)/[precision](#precision-and-recall) although it is calculated differently. Accuracy is calculated as:

$$
\frac{True Positives + True Negatives}{Positives+Negatives}
$$

Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)

---

### Active Learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Active learning is a variant of the [on-line learning](#on-line-learning) machine learning architecture where feedback about the ground truth class labels of unseen data can be requested if the classification is uncertain. New training data that was labeled can then be used to update the model as in [on-line learning](#on-line-learning).

---

### Anomaly detection

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Anomaly detection describes the task of identifying points that deviate from specific patterns in a dataset --  the so-called outliers. Different types of anomaly detection methods include graph-based, statistical-based and distance-based techniques and can be used in both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks.  

---

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a class of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the neuron architecture of the human brain. Typically, a (multi-layer) ANN consists of a layer of input nodes, a layer of output nodes, and hidden layers in-between. The nodes are connected by weighted links that can be interpreted as the neuron-connections by axons of different strengths.
The simplest version of an ANN is a single-layer [perceptron](#perceptron).

---

## B

### Backtesting

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Backtesting is a specific case of [cross-validation](#cross-validation) in the context of finance and trading models where empirical data from previous time periods (data from the past) is used to evaluate a trading strategy.

---

### Bagging

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Bagging is an ensemble method for classification (or regression analysis) in which individual models are trained by random sampling of data, and the final decision is made by voting among individual models with equal weights (or averaging for regression analysis).

---

### Bag of words

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Bag of words is a model that is used to construct sparse feature vectors for text classification tasks. The bag of words is an unordered set of all words that occur in all documents that are part of the training set. Every word is then associated with a count of how often it occurs whereas the positional information is ignored. Sometimes, the bag of words is also called "dictionary" or "vocabulary" based on the training data.

---

### Batch Gradient Descent

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Batch Gradient descent is a variant of a [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent) algorithm to optimize a function by finding its local minimum. In contrast to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](#stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd) the gradient is computed from the whole dataset.

---

### Bayes Theorem

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Naive Bayes' classifier:

- posterior probability:

$$
P(\omega_j|x) = \frac{p(x|\omega_j) \cdot P(\omega_j)}{p(x)}
$$

``` yml
P(\omega_j|x) = \frac{p(x|\omega_j) \cdot P(\omega_j)}{p(x)}
```

$$
\Rightarrow \text{posterior probability} = \frac{ \text{likelihood}  \cdot \text{prior probability}}{\text{evidence}}
$$

``` yml
\Rightarrow \text{posterior probability} = \frac{ \text{likelihood}  \cdot \text{prior probability}}{\text{evidence}}
```

- decision rule:

$$
\text{Decide } \omega_1  \text{ if }  P(\omega_1|x) > P(\omega_2|x)  \text{ else decide } \omega_2 .
$$

``` yml
\text{Decide } \omega_1  \text{ if }  P(\omega_1|x) > P(\omega_2|x)  \text{ else decide } \omega_2 .
```

$$
\frac{p(x|\omega_1) \cdot P(\omega_1)}{p(x)} > \frac{p(x|\omega_2) \cdot P(\omega_2)}{p(x)}
$$

``` yml
\frac{p(x|\omega_1) \cdot P(\omega_1)}{p(x)} > \frac{p(x|\omega_2) \cdot P(\omega_2)}{p(x)}
```

- objective functions:

$$
g_1(\pmb x) = P(\omega_1 | \; \pmb{x}), \quad  g_2(\pmb{x}) = P(\omega_2 | \; \pmb{x}), \quad  g_3(\pmb{x}) = P(\omega_2 | \; \pmb{x})
$$

``` yml
g_1(\pmb x) = P(\omega_1 | \; \pmb{x}), \quad  g_2(\pmb{x}) = P(\omega_2 | \; \pmb{x}), \quad  g_3(\pmb{x}) = P(\omega_2 | \; \pmb{x})
```

$$
\quad g_i(\pmb{x}) = \pmb{x}^{\,t} \bigg( - \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_i^{-1} \bigg) \pmb{x} + \bigg( \Sigma_i^{-1} \pmb{\mu}_{\,i}\bigg)^t \pmb x + \bigg( -\frac{1}{2} \pmb{\mu}_{\,i}^{\,t}  \Sigma_{i}^{-1} \pmb{\mu}_{\,i} -\frac{1}{2} ln(|\Sigma_i|)\bigg)
$$

``` yml
\quad g_i(\pmb{x}) = \pmb{x}^{\,t} \bigg( - \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_i^{-1} \bigg) \pmb{x} + \bigg( \Sigma_i^{-1} \pmb{\mu}_{\,i}\bigg)^t \pmb x + \bigg( -\frac{1}{2} \pmb{\mu}_{\,i}^{\,t}  \Sigma_{i}^{-1} \pmb{\mu}_{\,i} -\frac{1}{2} ln(|\Sigma_i|)\bigg)
```

---

### Batch Learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Batch learning is an architecture used in machine learning tasks where the entire training dataset is available upfront to build the model. In contrast to [on-line learning](#on-line-learning), the model is not updated once it was build on a training dataset.

---

### Big Data

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

There are many different, controversial interpretations and definitions for the term "Big Data". Typically, one refers to data as "Big Data" if its volume and complexity are of a magnitude that the data cannot be processed by "conventional" computing platforms anymore; storage space, processing power, and database structures are typically among the limiting factors.

---

### Binomial distribution

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

- Probability density function:

$$
p_k = {n \choose x} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

``` yml
p_k = {n \choose x} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
```

---

### Bootstrapping

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A resampling technique to that is closely related to [cross-validation](#cross-validation) where a training dataset is divided into random subsets. Bootstrapping -- in contrast to cross-validation -- is a random sampling **with** replacement. Bootstrapping is typically used for statistical estimation of bias and standard error, and a common application in machine learning is to estimate the generalization error of a predictor.

---

### Bregman divergence

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Bregman divergence describes are family of proximity functions (or distance measures) that share common properties and are often used in clustering algorithms. A popular example is the squared Euclidean distance.

---

## C

### Central Limit Theorem

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Central Limit Theorem is a theorem in the field of probability theory that expresses the idea
that the distribution of sample means (from independent random variables) converges to a normal distribution when the sample size approaches infinity.

---

### Co-Variance

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

$$
S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
$$

``` yml
S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
```

example covariance matrix:

$$
\pmb{\Sigma_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

``` yml
\pmb{\Sigma_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```

---

### Confusion Matrix

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The confusion matrix is used as a way to represent the performance of a classifier and is sometimes also called "error matrix". This square matrix consists of columns and rows that list the number of instances as absolute or relative "actual class" vs. "predicted class" ratios.

---

### Contingency Table

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A contingency table is used in clustering analysis to compare the overlap between two different clustering (grouping) results. The partitions from the two clustering results are represented as rows and columns in the table, and the individual elements of the table represent the number of elements that are shared between two partitions from each clustering result.  

---

### Correlation analysis

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Correlation analysis describes and quantifies the relationship between two independent variables. Typically, in case of a positive correlation both variables have a tendency to increase, and in the case of negative correlation, one variable increases while the other variable increases. It is important to mention the famous quotation "correlation does not imply causation".

---

### Correlation analysis, Canonical

Let **x** and **y** be two vectors, the goal of canonical correlation analysis is to maximize the correlation between linear transformations of those original vectors. With applications in dimensionality reduction and feature selection, CCA tries to find common dimensions between two vectors.

---

### Correlation analysis - Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

MCC is an assessment metric for clustering or binary classification analyses that represents the correlation between the observed (ground truth) and predicted labels. MCC can be directly computed from the [confusion matrix](#confusion-matrix) and returns a value between -1 and 1.

---

### Correlation analysis - Kendall

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Similar to the [Pearson correlation coefficient](#correlation-analysis-pearson), Kendall's tau measures the degree of a monotone relationship between variables, and like [Spearman's rho](#correlation-analysis-spearman), it calculates the dependence between ranked variables, which makes it feasible for non-normal distributed data. Kendall tau can be calculated for continuous as well as ordinal data. Roughly speaking, Kendall's tau distinguishes itself from Spearman's rho by stronger penalization of non-sequential (in context of the ranked variables) dislocations.

$$
\tau = \frac{c-d}{c+d} = \frac{S}{
\left(
\begin{matrix}
n \\
2
\end{matrix}
\right)}
= \frac{2S}{n(n-1)}
$$

``` yml
\tau = \frac{c-d}{c+d} = \frac{S}{
\left(
\begin{matrix}
n \\
2
\end{matrix}
\right)}
= \frac{2S}{n(n-1)}
```

where:

*c* = the number of concordant pairs
*d* = the number of discordant pairs  

[[Source](http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Kendall_tau_metric)]

If ties are present among the 2 ranked variables, the following equation shall be used instead:

$$
\tau = \frac{S}{\sqrt{n(n-1)/2-T}\sqrt{n(n-1)/2-U}}
$$

``` yml
\tau = \frac{S}{\sqrt{n(n-1)/2-T}\sqrt{n(n-1)/2-U}}
```

$$
T = \sum_t t(t-1)/2 \\
$$

``` yml
T = \sum_t t(t-1)/2 \\
```

$$
U = \sum_u u(u-1)/2 \\
$$

``` yml
U = \sum_u u(u-1)/2 \\
```

where:

*t* = number of observations of variable *x* that are tied  
*u* = number of observations of variable *y* that are tied  

---

### Correlation analysis - Pearson

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Pearson correlation coefficient is probably the most widely used measure for linear relationships between two normal distributed variables and thus often just called "correlation coefficient". Usually, the Pearson coefficient is obtained via a [Least-Squares fit](#least-squares-fit) and a value of 1 represents a perfect positive relation-ship, -1 a perfect negative relationship, and 0 indicates the absence of a relationship between variables.

$$
    \rho = \frac{\text{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$

``` yml
\rho = \frac{\text{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
```

And the estimate  

$$
r = \frac{{}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}
{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})^2(y_i - \overline{y})^2}}
$$

``` yml
r = \frac{{}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}
{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})^2(y_i - \overline{y})^2}}
```

---

### Correlation analysis - Spearman

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Related to the [Pearson correlation coefficient](#correlation-pearson), the Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) measures the relationship between two variables. Spearman's rho can be understood as a rank-based version of [Pearson's correlation coefficient](#correlation-pearson), which can be used for variables that are not normal-distributed and have a non-linear relationship. Also, its use is not only restricted to continuous data, but can also be used in analyses of ordinal attributes.

$$
\rho = 1- {\frac {6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}}
$$

``` yml
\rho = 1- {\frac {6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}}
```

where:
 *d* = the pairwise distances of the ranks of the variables *x<sub>i</sub>* and *y<sub>i</sub>* .  
 *n* = the number of samples.

---

### Cosine Similarity

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Cosine similarity measures the orientation of two *n*-dimensional sample vectors irrespective to their magnitude. It is calculated by the dot product of two numeric vectors, and it is normalized by the product of the vector lengths, so that output values close to 1 indicate high similarity.

$$
cos(\pmb x, \pmb y) = \frac {\pmb x \cdot \pmb y}{||\pmb x|| \cdot ||\pmb y||}
$$

``` yml
cos(\pmb x, \pmb y) = \frac {\pmb x \cdot \pmb y}{||\pmb x|| \cdot ||\pmb y||}
```

---

### Cost function

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A cost function (synonymous to loss function) is a special case of an [objective function](#objective-function), i.e., a function that is used for solving optimization problems. A cost function can take one or more input variables and the output variable is to be minimized. A typical use case for cost functions is parameter optimization.

---

### Cross-validation

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Cross-validation is a statistical technique to estimate the prediction error rate by splitting the data into training, cross-validation, and test datasets. A prediction model is obtained using the training set, and model parameters are optimized by the cross-validation set, while the test set is held primarily for empirical error estimation.  

---

### Cross-validation, K-fold

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

K-fold cross-validation  is a variant of [cross validation](#cross-validation) where contiguous segments of samples are selected from the training dataset to build two new subsets for every iteration (without replacement): a new training and test dataset (while the original test dataset is retained for the final evaluation of the predictor).

---

### Cross-validation, Leave-One-Out

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Leave-One-Out cross-validation a variant of [cross validation](#cross-validation) one sample is removed for every iteration (without replacement). The model is trained on the remaining N-1 samples and evaluated via the removed sample (while the original test dataset is retained for the final evaluation of the predictor).

---

### Cross-validation, Random Sampling

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Cross-validation via random sampling is a variant of [cross validation](#cross-validation) where random chunks of samples are extracted from the training dataset to build two new subsets for every iteration  (with or without replacement): a new training and test dataset for every iteration (while the original test dataset is retained for the final evaluation of the predictor).

---

### Curse of dimensionality

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

For a fixed number of training samples, the curse of dimensionality describes the increased error rate for a large number of dimensions (or features) due to imprecise parameter estimations.

---

## D

### Data mining

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A field that is closely related to machine learning and pattern classification. The focus of data mining does not lie in merely the collection of data, but the extraction of useful information: Discovery of patterns, and making inferences and predictions. Common techniques in data mining include predictive modeling, clustering, association rules, and anomaly detection.

---

### DBSCAN

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

DBSCAN is a variant of a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies core points as regions of high-densities based on their number of neighbors (> *MinPts*) in a specified radius (&epsilon;). Points that are below *MinPts* but within &epsilon; are specified as border points; the remaining points are classified as noise points.

---

### Decision rule

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A function in pattern classification tasks of making an "action", e.g., assigning a certain class label to an observation or pattern.

---

### Decision tree classifier

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Decision tree classifiers are tree like graphs, where nodes in the graph test certain conditions on a particular set of features, and branches split the decision towards the leaf nodes. Leaves represent lowest level in the graph and determine the class labels. Optimal tree are trained by minimizing Gini impurity, or maximizing information gain.  

---

### Density-based clustering

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

In density-based clustering, regions of high density in n-dimensional space are identified as clusters. The best advantage of this class of clustering algorithms is that they do not require apriori knowledge of number of clusters (as opposed to [k-means](#k-means-clustering) algorithm).

---

### Descriptive modeling

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Descriptive modeling is a common task in the field of [data mining](#data-mining) where a model is build in order to distinguish between objects  and categorize them into classes - a form of data summary. In contrast to [predictive modeling](#predictive-modeling), the scope of descriptive modeling does not extend to making prediction for unseen objects.

---

### Dimensionality reduction

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Dimensionality reduction is a data pre-processing step in machine learning applications that aims to avoid the [curse of dimensionality](#curse-of-dimensionality) and reduce the effect of overfitting.  Dimensionality reduction is related to [feature selection](#feature-selection), but instead of selecting a feature subset, dimensionality reduction takes as projection-based approach (e.g, linear transformation) in order to create a new feature subspace.

---

### Distance Metric Learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Distance metrics are fundamental for many machine learning algorithms. Distance metric learning - instead of learning a model - incorporates estimated relevances of features to obtain a distance metric for potentially optimal separation of classes and clusters: Large distances for objects from different classes, and small distances for objects of the same class, respectively.  

---

### Distance, Euclidean

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Euclidean distance is a distance measure between two points or or vectors in a two- or multidimensional (Euclidean) space based on Pythagoras' theorem. The distance is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared pair-wise distances of every dimension.  

$$
\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}
$$

``` yml
\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}
```

---

### Distance, Manhattan

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Manhattan distance (sometimes also called Taxicab distance) metric is related to the Euclidean distance, but instead of calculating the shortest diagonal path ("beeline") between two points, it calculates the distance based on gridlines. The Manhattan distance was named after the block-like layout of the streets in Manhattan.

$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}
$$

``` yml
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}
```

---

### Distance, Minkowski

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Minkowski distance is a generalized form of the Euclidean distance (if *p=2*) and the Manhattan distance (if *p=1*).  

$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}
$$

``` yml
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}
```

---

## E

### Eager learners

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Eager learners (in contrast to [lazy learners](lazy-learners)) describe machine learning algorithms that learn a model for mapping attributes to class labels as soon as the data becomes available (e.g., [Decision tree classifiers](#decision-tree-classifier) or [naive Bayes classifiers](#naive-bayes-classifier)) and do not require the training data for making predictions on unseen samples once the model was built. The most computationally expensive step is the creation of a prediction model from the training data, and the actual prediction is considered as relatively inexpensive.

---

### Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Both eigenvectors and eigenvalues fundamental in many applications involve linear systems and are related via *A&middot;v = &lambda;&middot;v* (where *A* is a square matrix, *v* the eigenvector, and &lambda; the eigenvalue). Eigenvectors are describing the direction of the axes of a linear transformation, whereas eigenvalues are describing the scale or magnitude.

$$
\pmb A\pmb{v} =  \lambda\pmb{v}\\
$$

``` yml
\pmb A\pmb{v} =  \lambda\pmb{v}\\

where:

$$
\pmb A = S_{W}^{-1}S_B\\
\pmb{v} = \text{Eigenvector}\\
\lambda = \text{Eigenvalue}

### Ensemble methods

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Ensemble methods combine multiple classifiers which may differ in algorithms, input features, or input samples. Statistical analyses showed that ensemble methods yield better classification performances and are also less prone to overfitting. Different methods, e.g., bagging or boosting, are used to construct the final classification decision based on weighted votes.

### Evolutionary algorithms

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Evolutionary algorithms are a class of algorithms that are based on [heuristic search](#heuristic-search) methods inspired by biological evolution in order to solve optimization problems.

---

### Exhaustive search

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Exhaustive search (synonymous to brute-force search) is a problem-solving approach where all possible combinations are sequentially evaluated to find the optimal solution. Exhaustive search guarantees to find the optimal solution whereas other approaches (e.g., [heuristic searches](#heuristic-search)) are regarded as sub-optimal. A downside of exhaustive searches is that computational costs increase proportional to the number of combinations to be evaluated.

### Expectation Maximization algorithm - EM

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) is a technique to estimate parameters of a distribution based on the [Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)](#maximum-likelihood-estimates-mle) that is often used for the imputation of missing values in incomplete datasets. After the EM algorithm is initialized with a starting value, alternating iterations between expectation and maximization steps are repeated until convergence. In the expectation step, parameters are estimated based on the current model to impute missing values. In the maximization step, the log-likelihood function of the statistical model is to be maximized by re-estimating the parameters based on the imputed values from the expectation step.

### Feature Selection

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Feature selection is an important pre-processing step in many machine learning applications in order to avoid the [curse of dimensionality](#curse-of-dimensionality) and [overfitting](#overfitting). A subset of features is typically selected by evaluating different combinations of features and eventually retain the subset that minimizes a specified [cost function](#cost-function). Commonly used algorithms for feature selection as alternative to [exhaustive search](#exhaustive-search) algorithms include sequential selection algorithms and genetic algorithms.

### Fuzzy C-Means Clustering

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Fuzzy C-Means is a soft clustering algorithm in which each sample point has a membership degree to each cluster; in hard (crisp) clustering, membership of each point to each cluster is either 0 or 1. Fuzzy C-Means considers a weight matrix for cluster memberships, and minimizes sum squared error (SSE) of weighted distances of sample points to the cluster centroids.

### Hyperparameters

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Hyperparameters are the parameters of a classifier or estimator that are not directly learned in the machine learning step from the training data but are optimized separately (e.g., via [Grid Search](#grid-search)). The goal of hyperparameter optimization is to achieve good generalization of a learning algorithm and to avoid overfitting to the training data.

---

## I

### iid

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The abbreviation "iid" stands for "independent and identically distributed" and describes random variables that are independent from one another and are drawn from a similar probability distribution. Independence means that the probability of one observation does not affect the probability of another variable (e.g., time series and network graphs are not independent).  One popular example of iid would be the tossing of a coin: One coin toss does not affect the outcome of another coin toss, and the probability of the coin landing on either "heads" or "tails" is the same for every coin toss.

---

### Imputation

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Imputations algorithms are designed to replace the missing data (NAs) with certain statistics rather than discarding them for downstream analysis. Commonly used imputation methods include mean imputation (replacement by the sample mean of an attribute), kNN imputation, and regression imputation.  

---

### Independent Component Analysis

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical signal-processing technique that decomposes a multivariate dataset of mixed, non-gaussian distributed source signals into  independent components.

## J

### Jaccard coefficient

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Jaccard coefficient (bounded at [0, 1)) is used as similarity measure for asymmetric binary data and calculated by taking the number of matching attributes and divide it by the number of all attributes except those where both variables have a value 0 in contrast to a [simple matching coefficient](#simple-matching-coefficient). A popular application is the identification of near-duplicate documents for which the Jaccard coefficient can be calculated by the dividing the intersection of the set of words by the union of the set words in both documents.

### Jackknifing

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Jackknifing is a resampling technique that predates the related [cross-validation](#cross-validation) and [bootstrapping](#bootstrapping) techniques and is mostly used for bias and variance estimations. In jackknifing, a dataset is split into N subsets where exactly one sample is removed from every subset so that every subset is of size N-1.

### Jittering

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Jittering is a sampling technique that can be used to measure the stability of a given statistical model (classifiction/regression/clustering). In jittering, some noise is added to sample data points, and then a new model is drawn and compared to the original model.

### k-D Trees

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

k-D trees are a data structures (recursive space partitioning trees) that result from the binary partitioning of multi-dimensional feature spaces. A typical application of k-D trees is to increase the search efficiency for nearest-neighbor searches. A k-D tree construction can be described as a iterating process with the following steps: Select the dimension of largest variance, draw a cutting plane based at the median along the dimension to split the data into 2 halves, choose the next dimension.

In the context of [kernel methods](#kernel-methods the term “kernel” describes a function that calculates the dot product of the images of the samples **x** under the kernel function &phi; (see kernel methods). Roughly speaking, a kernel can be understood as a similarity measure in higher-dimensional space.

---

### Kernel Methods

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Kernel methods are algorithms that map the sample vectors of a dataset onto a higher-dimensional feature space via a so-called kernel function (&phi;(x)). The goal is to identify  and simplify general relationships between data, which is especially useful for linearly non-separable datasets.  

---

### Kernel Trick

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Since the explicit computation of the [kernel](#kernel-in-statistics) is increasingly computationally expensive for large sample sizes and high numbers of dimensions, the kernel trick uses approximations to calculate the kernel implicitly. The most popular kernels used for the kernel trick are Gaussian Radius Basis Function (RBF) kernels, sigmoidal kernels, and polynomial kernels.

---

### k-fold Cross-validation

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

In k-fold cross-validation the data is split into *k* subsets, then a prediction/classification model is trained *k* times, each time holding one subset as test set, training the model parameters using the remaining *k*-1. Finally, cross-validation error is evaluated as the average error out of all *k* training models.  

---

### K-Means Clustering

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A method of partitioning a dataset into *k* clusters by picking *k* random initial points (where *k* < *n*, the number or total points - modified by *S.R.*), assigning clusters, averaging, reassigning, and repeating until stability is achieved. The number *k* must be chosen beforehand.  

---

### K-Means++ Clustering

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A variant of [k-means](#k-means-clustering) where instead of choosing all initial centers randomly, the first is chosen randomly, the second chosen with probability proportional to the squared distance from the first, the third chosen with probability proportional to the square distance from the first two, etc. See [this paper](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/778/1/2006-13.pdf).

---

### K-Medoids Clustering  

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

K-Medoids clustering is a variant of [k-means](#k-means-clustering) algorithm in which cluster centroids are picked among the sample points rather than the mean point of each cluster. K-Medoids can overcome some of the limitations of [k-means](#k-means-clustering) algorithm by avoiding empty clusters, being more robust to outliers, and being more easily applicable to non-numeric data types.  

---

### K-nearest neighbors algorithms  

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]  

K-nearest neighbors algorithms find the k-points that are closest to a point of interest based on their attributes using a certain distance measure (e.g., Euclidean distance).

## L

### LASSO Regression

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression model that uses the L1-norm (sum of absolute values) of model coefficients to penalize the model complexity. LASSO has the advantage that some coefficients can become zero, as opposed to [ridge regression](#ridge-regression) that uses the squared sum of model coefficients.  

---

### Latent Semantic Indexing

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a [data mining](#data-mining) technique to characterize documents by topics, word usage, or other contexts. The structures of the documents are compared by applying  [singular value decomposition](#singular-value-decomposition-svd) to an input term-document matrix (e.g., a data table of word counts with terms as row labels and document numbers as column labels) in order to obtain the singular values and vectors.

---

### Law of Large Numbers

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Law of Large Numbers is a theorem in the field of probability theory that expresses the idea that the actual value of a random sampling process approaches the expected value for growing sample sizes. A common example is that the observed ratio of "heads" in an unbiased coin-flip experiment will approach 0.5 for large sample sizes.

---

### Lazy learners

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Lazy learners (in contrast to [eager learners](#eager-learners)) are memorizing training data in order to make predictions for unseen samples. While there is no expensive learning step involved, the prediction step is generally considered to be more expensive compared to [eager learners](#eager-learners) since it involves the evaluation of training data. One example of lazy learners are [k-nearest neighbor algorithms](#k-nearest-neighbors-algorithms) where the class label of a unseen sample is estimated by e.g., the majority of class labels of its neighbors in the training data.

 can be pictured as probability to observe a particular sequence of patterns,  
where the probability of observing a particular patterns depends on **&theta;**, the parameters the underlying (class-conditional) distribution. In order to apply MLE, we have to make the assumption that the samples are *i.i.d.* (independent and identically distributed).

$$
p(D\; | \;  \pmb \theta\;)
= p(\pmb x_1 \; | \; \pmb \theta\;)\; \cdot \; p(\pmb x_2 \; | \;\pmb \theta\;) \; \cdot \;...  \; p(\pmb x_n \; | \; \pmb \theta\;)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

MinHash is a commonly used technique for dimensionality reduction in document similarity comparisons. The idea behind MinHash is to create a signature of reduced dimensionality while preserving the [Jaccard similarity coefficient](#jaccard-coefficient). A common implementation of MinHash is to generate *k* random permutations of the columns in a *m*x*n*-document matrix (rows represent the sparse vectors of words for each document as binary data) and generate a new matrix of size *m*x*k*. The cells of the new matrix now contain the position labels of the first non-zero value for every document (1 column for each round of random permutation). Based on similarities of the position labels, the Jaccard coefficient for the pairs of documents can be calculated.

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A classifier based on a statistical model (i.e., Bayes theorem: calculating posterior probabilities based on the prior probability and the so-called likelihood) in the field of pattern classification.

In context of natural language processing (NLP), a text is typically broken down into individual elements (see [tokenization](#tokenization)). N-grams describe the length of the individual elements where n refers to the number of words or symbols in every token. E.g., a unigram (or 1-gram) can represent a single word, and a bigram (or 2-gram) describes a token that consists of 2 words etc.

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Normal modes are the harmonic oscillations of a system of masses connected by springs, or roughly speaking "concerted motions," and all normal modes of a system are independent from each other.  A classic example describes two masses connected by a middle spring, and each mass is connected to a fixed outer edge ( |~~~m1~~m2~~~|). The oscillation of this system where the middle spring does not move is defined as its normal mode.

### Objective function

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Objective functions are mathematical function that are used for problem-solving and optimization tasks. Depending on the task, the objective function can be omtpimized through minimization ([cost or loss functions](#cost-function)) or maximization (reward function). A typical application of an objective function in pattern classification tasks is to minimize the error rate of a classifier.

### On-Line Learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

On-line learning is a machine learning architecture where the model is being updated consecutively as new training data arrives in contrast to [batch-learning](#batch-learning), which requires the entire training dataset to be available upfront. On-line has the advantage that a model can be updated and refined over time to account for changes in the population of training samples. A popular example where on-line learning is beneficial is the task of spam detection.

### Parzen-Rosenblatt Window technique

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A non-parametric kernel density estimation technique for probability densities of random variables if the underlying distribution/model is unknown. A so-called window function is used to count samples within hypercubes or Gaussian kernels of a specified volume to estimate the probability density.

$$
\phi(\pmb u) = \Bigg[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \quad |u_j| \leq 1/2 \; ;\quad \quad j = 1, ..., d \\
0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array}
$$

``` yml
\phi(\pmb u) = \Bigg[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \quad |u_j| \leq 1/2 \; ;\quad \quad j = 1, ..., d \\
0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array}
```

for a hypercube of unit length 1 centered at the coordinate system's origin. What this function basically does is assigning a value 1 to a sample point if it lies within 1/2 of the edges of the hypercube, and 0 if lies outside (note that the evaluation is done for all dimensions of the sample point).

If we extend on this concept, we can define a more general equation that applies to hypercubes of any length *h <sub> n</sub>* that are centered at ***x***:

$$
k_n = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \phi \bigg( \frac{\pmb x - \pmb x_i}{h_n} \bigg)\\\\
$$

``` yml
k_n = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \phi \bigg( \frac{\pmb x - \pmb x_i}{h_n} \bigg)\\\\
```

where:

$$
\pmb u = \bigg( \frac{\pmb x - \pmb x_i}{h_n} \bigg)
$$

$$

``` yml
p_n(\pmb x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{h^d} \phi \Bigg[ \frac{1}{(\sqrt {2 \pi})^d h_{n}^{d}} \exp \; \bigg[ -\frac{1}{2} \bigg(\frac{\pmb x - \pmb x_i}{h_n} \bigg)^2 \bigg] \Bigg]

### Proportion of Variance Explained

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

In the context of dimensionality reduction, the proportion of variance explained (PVE) describes how much of the total variance is captured by the new selected axes, for example,  principal components or discriminant axes.

### Purity Measure

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

In a cluster analysis with given truth cluster memberships (or classes), "purity" is used to assess the effectiveness of clustering.

### Quantitative and qualitative attributes

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Quantitative attributes are also often called "numeric"; those are attributes for which calculations and comparisons like ratios and intervals make sense (e.g., temperature in Celsius). Qualitative, or "categorical", attributes can be grouped into to subclasses: nominal and ordinal. Where ordinal attributes (e.g., street numbers) can be ordered, nominal attributes can only distinguished by their category names (e.g., colors).

$$
R = \frac{\sum ||F_{obs}| - |F_{calc}||}{\sum|F_{obs}|}

### Regularization

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Regularization is a technique to overcome overfitting by introducing a penalty term for model complexity.

Regularization may increase the training error but can potentially reduce the classification error on the test dataset.  

---

### Reinforcement learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning algorithm that learns from a series of actions by maximizing a "reward function". The reward function can either be maximized by penalizing "bad actions" and/or rewarding "good actions".

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Silhouette measure provides a metric to evaluate the performance of a clustering analysis. For each data point *i*, it measures the average distance of point *i* to all other points in the same cluster *(a(i))*, and the minimum distance to points from other clusters *(b(i))*. The average silhouette measures for each cluster can provide a visual way to pick the proper number of clusters.

### Term frequency and document frequency

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Term frequency and document frequency are commonly used measures in context of text classification tasks. Term frequency is the count of how often a particular word occurs in a particular document. In contrast, document frequency measures the presence or absence of a particular word in a document as a binary value. Thus, for a single document, the document frequency is either 1 or 0.
